# Transformer-less Power Supply

## Overview

This project is a low-cost transformer-less AC to DC power supply using widely available through-hole components and the LM7805 voltage regulator IC. It includes board images, schematic, and Interactive BOM for easy assembly.

## Features

- **Input**: ~230V AC (mains)
- **Output**: 5V DC (regulated, LM7805)
- **Small PCB Footprint**
- **Visual indicator**: Power LED
- **Basic over-voltage protection** (Zener)

## Project Files

- `/images/3D.jpg` – 3D render of the board
- `/images/PCB.jpg` – PCB layout image
- `/images/Schematic.jpg` – Circuit schematic
- `/ibom/ibom.html` – Interactive BOM for assembly

## Getting Started

1. **Fabricate the PCB** using the layout image or shared Gerber files.
2. **Assemble components** referring to the images and Interactive BOM: `ibom.html`.
3. **Connect and test** with AC mains following all safety precautions.
